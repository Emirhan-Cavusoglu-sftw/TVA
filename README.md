# TimeWeave

### Inspiration
Our inspiration for TimeWeave stemmed from the need to revolutionize the protection of unregistered product designs and copyrights. Drawing insights from discussions with a legal expert, who also happens to be a member's father, we recognized the necessity for such a solution in the market. This insight motivated us to harness blockchain technology, specifically leveraging Solidity, Next.js, Foundry, IPFS, and dynamic auth, to create a decentralized system that ensures creators have immutable evidence for their designs, especially the unregistered ones.

### What It Does
TimeWeave is a blockchain-based platform designed to register and verify product designs and copyrights, particularly focusing on those that are unregistered. By utilizing blockchain technology, our platform provides creators with immutable evidence, offering them a decentralized solution for protecting their intellectual property rights. With the incorporation of Account Abstraction, we prioritize delivering an exceptional user experience.

### How We Built It
We built TimeWeave using a combination of technologies including Solidity, Next.js, Foundry, IPFS, and dynamic auth. Employing a hybrid system, which integrates both Scroll Network and Tron Network contracts, posed a significant challenge during development. However, through meticulous optimization, we successfully implemented the system to ensure seamless functionality and an outstanding user experience.

### Challenges We Ran Into
One of the major challenges we encountered was optimizing the frontend with TronWeb while simultaneously implementing a hybrid system. Integrating contracts from both Scroll Network and Tron Network required careful coordination to ensure compatibility and efficiency. Overcoming this challenge demanded innovative solutions and extensive testing to achieve the desired performance and user experience.

### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We take pride in successfully optimizing the system and delivering a seamless user experience. By effectively combining blockchain technology with Account Abstraction, we have created a platform that empowers creators to protect their intellectual property rights with immutable evidence. Additionally, receiving validation and inspiration from a legal expert further reinforces our belief in the significance of TimeWeave's mission.

### What We Learned
Throughout the development process, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of integrating blockchain technology into real-world applications. Addressing challenges such as frontend optimization and hybrid system implementation deepened our understanding of blockchain architecture and its practical implications. Moreover, collaborating with legal experts provided us with invaluable perspectives on the necessity and potential impact of our solution.

### What's Next for TimeWeave
Looking ahead, our goal for TimeWeave is to further optimize the platform and transition from a hybrid system to full integration with Tron or broader adoption across multiple networks. We aim to refine the user experience, enhance scalability, and explore additional features to better serve creators and protect their intellectual property rights. Through continuous innovation and development, we envision TimeWeave becoming the premier solution for registering and verifying product designs and copyrights on the blockchain.
